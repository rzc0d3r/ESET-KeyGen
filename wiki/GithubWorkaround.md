# Workaround against Github blocking by ESET Antivirus

### The second way to solve the problem is to add the github domain to ESET's internet protection exceptions:
1. Read [this](https://help.eset.com/essp/17/en-US/idh_config_epfw_url_set_manager.html?idh_config_epfw_scan_http_address_list.html)
2. Open the menu that is shown on the site mentioned in the first step
3. Select **List of allowed addresses** and click on **Edit** button
4. A window will appear with a list that can be changed, click on the **Add** button and enter ```https://github.com/rzc0d3r*``` in the field that appears!
5. Next, click **OK** button until the **Advanced Setup** window closes!
6. Now you can access my repositories again even with internet protection enabled!
