  2. Then in the console you'll see *"Enter an email address you have access to"* and you'll need to enter a real existing email address that you can read incoming emails to. I suggest using a temporary email for this, such as [TempMail](https://temp-mail.org)
  > Then the algorithm will continue as in the first method

  3. After some time in the console you will see the message *"Enter the link to activate your account, it will come to the email address you provide"*, here you need to go to your email and find mail in inbox (you will have to wait)
    
     **FROM: info@product.eset.com**
     
     **SUBJECT: Account Confirmation**

     Then open that email and copy the link that is in the button (right click on the button, copy link address) and paste it into the console. If you have done everything correctly, the generation will complete successfully!

## 4. Unbinding license key from ESET ProtectHub account
Once the **ProtectHub** key has been successfully generated and obtained from the site, you can delete it from the created account (this will not affect the functionality of the key).
This will allow you to bind the key to another **ProtectHub** account (sometimes this can be useful).

To do this, enter ```Y``` to confirm and ```N``` to decline after the message appears in the console:
