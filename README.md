### My github page is currently blocked by ESET Antivirus, so you will not be able to access the project.
### Before you can access my github page, you need to disable internet protection in Eset Antivirus. You now have access to this release! After you have done everything you want to do, turn internet protection back on.

# How to use

## Using GitHub Actions CI
You can simply use the GitHub actions workflow given [here](https://github.com/rzc0d3r/ESET-KeyGen/blob/main/.github/workflows/eset.yml) in your GitHub repo.

Make a fork of my project. Go to it.
Then goto the **Actions** tab, choose **Generator** actions and then run the workflow.

It will ask the number of accounts, keys to be generated.

# Additional information

1. It is recommended to run the project as a non-administrator or root user.
2. Do not minimize or close the browser window before the program is finished!!!
3. Do not create many license keys and accounts in a short period of time, otherwise you will be blocked in ESET HOME for a certain period of time
4. If the program crashes after many attempts and you know that the program is up to date. Try using a VPN
5. If an ACT0 error occurs during activation, check whether the ESET HOME account is connected. If so, disconnect it and try again.
   If the error persists, try activating with [Account Generator](https://github.com/rzc0d3r/ESET-KeyGen/blob/main/wiki/AccountGenerator.md).
   If still getting this error reinstall ESET and try again.
6. Found an activation error under the code ecp4125, which appears when you try to activate the antivirus with an account.
   Perhaps not everyone has it error, but still try it, and if it does not work, use the keys. 
7. You can test the argument ```--skip-webdriver-menu``` theoretically the program itself will install the browser and web driver to it!
